Python curriculum for students involves a balance between introducing foundational programming concepts and providing more advanced topics suitable for high school students. The aim is to build a solid foundation in Python while encouraging problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

### Part 1: Introduction to Python
#### 1. **Getting Started**
   - Overview of Python
   - Why Python is important
   - Installing Python and setting up an IDE (like PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook)

#### 2. **Basic Concepts**
   - Introduction to data types (integers, strings, floats, booleans)
   - Variables and expressions
   - Simple input/output with `print()` and `input()`

### Part 2: Control Structures
#### 1. **Conditional Statements**
   - `if`, `elif`, `else`: Making decisions in code
   - Practical exercises (e.g., simple grade calculator)

#### 2. **Loops**
   - `for` loops and `while` loops
   - Nested loops
   - Projects like creating a multiplication table printer, simple pattern drawing

### Part 3: Data Handling
#### 1. **Working with Lists**
   - Creating and manipulating lists
   - List methods and operations
   - Mini-project: Building a to-do list application

#### 2. **Tuples and Dictionaries**
   - Differences between lists and tuples
   - Creating and using dictionaries
   - Practical use cases like phone book applications

### Part 4: Functions and Modules
#### 1. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Parameters and return values
   - Modular programming by dividing tasks into functions

#### 2. **Modules**
   - Using standard library modules (e.g., `math`, `datetime`)
   - Creating and importing custom modules
   - Mini-projects: Building a simple calculator using functions and modules

### Part 5: Advanced Concepts
#### 1. **File Input/Output**
   - Reading from and writing to files
   - Handling different types of data (text, CSV)
   - Project: Managing a simple database (like a CSV file of student grades)

#### 2. **Error Handling**
   - Try and except blocks
   - Managing exceptions in programs
   - Enhancing previous projects with error handling

### Part 6: Object-Oriented Programming
#### 1. **Introduction to OOP**
   - Understanding classes and objects
   - Attributes and methods
   - Simple class-based projects (like creating a library management system)

#### 2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - Extending classes through inheritance
   - Overriding methods
   - Practical exercises: Developing simple games or simulations

### Part 7: Practical Applications and Projects
#### 1. **Mini-Projects**
   - Calculator
   - Simple bank system
   - Quiz game

#### 2. **Capstone Project**
   - Design and development of a final project that encompasses all learned topics
   - Examples: A text-based adventure game, a basic web application using Flask, a data analysis project using pandas and matplotlib

### Part 8: Review and Advanced Study
- **Review Sessions**: Recap of major topics
- **Advanced Study**: Introduction to more complex topics such as data science with Python, web development, or GUI applications if time and interest permit.
